  <h1>Features and limitations</h1>
  
  <p>VoxelDesc is a pure voxel editor. A full description of voxels is outside the scope of this manual. Suffice to say, just as an ordinary picture (say, a GIF) is made of little colored squares arranged in a grid -- called pixels -- a voxel scene is made of little colored <em>cubes</em> which just happen to have a depth as well. That's it. No lighting or other fancy effects. You make voxels stand out from each other by giving them different colors, just like you would in pixel art.
  
  <p>In theory, VoxelDesc supports scenes of up to 16.7 million voxels (256x256x256). In practice, 10K voxels already slow down the app noticeably. Then again, I have an old machine. YMMV.
  
  <p>The scripting language used in VoxelDesc is Javascript, the same as in any web browser, except without the baggage. You can use it to do anything, even write completely unrelated applications on top of VoxelDesc. That's of course pointless, but I saw no reason to restrict this power.
