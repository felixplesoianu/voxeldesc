  <h1>Advanced example</h1>
  
  <p>Open the scripting console and paste in the following code:
  
  <code><pre>

        camera.moveTo(10, 30, -40);
        for (x = 0; x &lt;= 20; x += 2)
                for (y = 0; y &lt;= 20; y += 2)
                        for (z = 0; z &lt;= 20; z += 2)
                                scene.color(x * 10, y * 10, z * 10).dot(x, y, z);
        canvas.repaint();
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>Now press Alt-R, or click the "Run" button on the console toolbar.
  (You can't use the Enter key because you need it to edit scripts here.)
  
  <p>Note the call to <code>canvas.repaint()</code> at the end; we
  need that in the console, because the console lacks certain
  conveniences; it's a "backstage access" to VoxelDesc and assumes
  you know what you're doing.
  
  <p>The scripting language used in VoxelDesc is Javascript, because
  that's what the Java platform provides by default. A tutorial is
  outside the scope of this manual, but feel free to experiment. Try
  out the various operations described these pages, and change the
  examples to suit your needs. You can't break anything.
