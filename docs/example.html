  <h1>Advanced example</h1>
  
  <p>Open the scripting console and paste in the following code:
  
  <code><pre>

        camera.moveTo(10, 30, -40);
        for (x = 0; x &lt;= 20; x += 2)
                for (y = 0; y &lt;= 20; y += 2)
                        for (z = 0; z &lt;= 20; z += 2)
                                scene.color(x * 10, y * 10, z * 10).dot(x, y, z);
        canvas.repaint();
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>Note the call to <code>canvas.repaint()</code> at the end; we
  only need that in the console. You could type the entire thing at
  the command line, in which case VoxelDesc would auto-repaint the
  canvas for you. But in the console you have more room to play around.
  Error messages are also shown here instead of the main window.
  
  <p>The scripting language used in VoxelDesc is Javascript, because
  that's what the Java platform provides by default. A tutorial is
  outside the scope of this manual, but feel free to experiment. Try
  out the various operations described these pages, and change the
  examples to suit your needs. You can't break anything.
