  <h1>Camera object</h1>
  
  <p>VoxelDesc employs a 2.5D, a.k.a. pseudo-3D camera. That means you can place it anywhere (even between voxels), but it can't tilt or rotate -- it always points straight along the Z axis into the distance.
  
  <p>Speaking of which, VoxelDesc uses the so called left-hand coordinate system. That means the X axis grows towards the right, the Y axis upwards, and the Z axis is going into the screen, away from you.
  
  <h2>How to use</h2>
  
  <p>The simplest thing you can do with the camera is to type <code>camera</code> on the command line; that will report its current posision. You can also interrogate and change its coordinates individually:
  
  <code><pre>
          
        camera.x;
        camera.x = 30;
  </pre></code>
  
  <p>The "focal distance" .f is always kept equal to the canvas height, so there's no point trying to change it.
  
  <p>In addition, the <code>camera</code> object supports the following operations:
  
  <dl>
   <dt>.moveTo(x, y, z)</dt>
   <dd>Place the camera at an absolute position.</dd>
   <dt>.moveBy(x, y, z)</dt>
   <dd>Move the camera by that many voxels in each direction.</dd>
   <dt>.zoomIn(n)</dt>
   <dt>.zoomOut(n)</dt>
   <dd>Scale all the camera coordinates by the specified amount.</dd>
   <dt>.left(n)</dt>
   <dt>.right(n)</dt>
   <dt>.up(n)</dt>
   <dt>.down(n)</dt>
   <dt>.back(n)</dt>
   <dt>.fore(n)</dt>
   <dd>Move the camera by that many voxels in the specified direction.</dd>
   <dt>.center()</dt>
   <dd>Bring the camera to x = 0 and a pleasing height above the "floor".
  </dl>
  
  <p>You can chain any number of these as follows: <code>camera.left(10).zoomOut(3).center();</code> though in practice you won't often need to. You can also place the camera anywhere, even way outside the scene, so beware. If you're lost, remember that scene coordinates only go from -128 to +127 on each axis.
