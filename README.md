VoxelDesc
=========

VoxelDesc is a voxel editor driven by a command line, for Java 6 and later, with 2.5D graphics and powerful scripting.

Typical voxel editors would have you place every single voxel by clicking with the mouse, which is slow, repetitive and error-prone. All the tedium of Minecraft with none of the fun! By contrast, VoxelDesc will allow you to say things like <code>scene.color(red).from(-2, -2, -2).fill(4, 4, 4)</code>. This is not for everyone. But in the right hands, it should enable the creation of sophisticated scenes.

As of 2014-10-23, VoxelDesc is in beta, and usable if incomplete.
