VoxelDesc
=========

VoxelDesc is a voxel editor driven by a command line, for Java 6 and 7, with 2.5D graphics and powerful scripting.

Typical voxel editors would have you place every single voxel by clicking with the mouse, which is slow, repetitive and error-prone. All the tedium of Minecraft with none of the fun! By contrast, VoxelDesc will allow you to say things like "scene.from(-2, -2, -2).box(5, 5, 5)". This is not for everyone. But in the right hands, it should enable the creation of sophisticated scenes.

As of 2014-10-03, VoxelDesc is in incipient form. It compiles and runs, and you can enter basic commands like the one above, but not much more.
